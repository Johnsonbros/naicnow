    <div class="article-content" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      <p>Boundaries. Every coach knows they need them. Few coaches find them easy to maintain.</p>
      <p>The nature of coaching creates a unique challenge: you're building deep, transformational relationships while simultaneously running a business. Where does care end and over-functioning begin? Here's how to navigate it.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Why Boundaries Matter</h2>
      <p>Poor boundaries don't just affect you—they affect your clients too. When you're exhausted, resentful, or stretched too thin, the quality of your coaching suffers.</p>
      <p>Clear boundaries actually enhance the coaching relationship by:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Modeling healthy behavior for your clients</li>
        <li>Creating a safe, predictable container for the work</li>
        <li>Ensuring you show up fully present and energized</li>
        <li>Building mutual respect between coach and client</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">The Boundaries You Need</h2>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Time Boundaries</h3>
      <p>Decide when you're available and when you're not. This includes:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li><strong>Session hours:</strong> What days and times do you offer sessions?</li>
        <li><strong>Response time:</strong> How quickly will you respond to messages between sessions?</li>
        <li><strong>Session length:</strong> Start and end on time, every time.</li>
        <li><strong>After-hours contact:</strong> Is it ever acceptable? Under what circumstances?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Put these in writing. Include them in your coaching agreement. Then honor them consistently.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Scope Boundaries</h3>
      <p>Coaching is not therapy. Coaching is not consulting. Coaching is not friendship.</p>
      <p>Know where your work ends and other professionals' work begins. Have referral resources ready for when clients need support beyond your scope:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Therapists or counselors for mental health issues</li>
        <li>Consultants for specific technical expertise</li>
        <li>Other specialists relevant to your niche</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Emotional Boundaries</h3>
      <p>You can care deeply about your clients without carrying their problems home. This is perhaps the hardest boundary to maintain—and the most important.</p>
      <p>Strategies that help:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Develop end-of-session rituals that help you transition</li>
        <li>Work with your own coach or supervisor</li>
        <li>Practice distinguishing empathy from enmeshment</li>
        <li>Remember: their journey is theirs. Your job is to support, not to save.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">How to Communicate Boundaries</h2>
      <p>The best time to set expectations is before problems arise. Include your policies in your:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Coaching agreement (the formal document clients sign)</li>
        <li>Welcome packet or onboarding process</li>
        <li>Initial chemistry call or discovery session</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When boundaries need to be reinforced, be direct but kind:</p>
      <p><em>"I'm not available on weekends, but I'll respond to your message first thing Monday."</em></p>
      <p><em>"That's outside my expertise. I'd like to refer you to someone who can help with that specifically."</em></p>
      <p><em>"Our sessions run 60 minutes. We have 5 minutes left—what's most important to address?"</em></p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">When Clients Push Back</h2>
      <p>Some clients will test your boundaries. This isn't always malicious—sometimes it's unconscious, sometimes it's exactly what they do in other relationships too (which becomes coaching material).</p>
      <p>When pushback happens:</p>
      <ol style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li><strong>Stay calm.</strong> Boundary enforcement isn't punishment; it's clarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Restate the boundary simply.</strong> No need to over-explain or apologize.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore the dynamic if appropriate.</strong> "I notice you've reached out after hours a few times. What's coming up for you there?"</li>
        <li><strong>Follow through.</strong> A boundary you don't maintain isn't a boundary—it's a suggestion.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Boundaries as Self-Care</h2>
      <p>At the end of the day, boundaries protect your capacity to do this work long-term. Coaching is demanding. If you burn out, you help no one.</p>
      <p>Think of boundaries not as walls that keep clients out, but as fences that define the garden where transformation can grow. Within that container, magic happens. Outside it, chaos creeps in.</p>
      <p>Your clients deserve a coach who's fully present, energized, and sustainable. That requires boundaries. Don't apologize for having them.</p>
