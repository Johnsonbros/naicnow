    <div class="article-content" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      <p>Starting a coaching practice can feel overwhelming. There are a thousand things to do, and it's easy to get lost in the details before you ever work with your first client. Let's cut through the noise and focus on what actually matters.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Step 1: Define Your Niche (But Don't Overthink It)</h2>
      <p>You've heard this advice before: pick a niche. And it's good advice—but it comes with a caveat. Your first niche doesn't have to be your forever niche.</p>
      <p>Start with what you know. What problems have you solved in your own life? What professional expertise do you bring? Who do you naturally connect with? These questions will point you toward your initial focus.</p>
      <p>You can refine your niche as you work with clients and discover what energizes you most. Perfection isn't required at the starting line.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Step 2: Get Your Credentials in Order</h2>
      <p>Coaching is an unregulated industry, which means anyone can call themselves a coach. That's both a blessing and a challenge. It's easy to enter the field, but you need to stand out from those who aren't serious about the craft.</p>
      <p>Consider getting certified through a recognized program—ICF, CCE, or a specialty-specific certification. Not because you need it legally, but because:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>It signals commitment to your craft</li>
        <li>It gives you frameworks and tools to draw from</li>
        <li>It builds your confidence</li>
        <li>Many clients and organizations require or prefer certified coaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Step 3: Set Up Your Business Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>You don't need much to get started, but you do need the basics:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li><strong>Legal structure:</strong> Sole proprietorship or LLC, depending on your situation</li>
        <li><strong>Business bank account:</strong> Keep personal and business finances separate</li>
        <li><strong>Liability insurance:</strong> Protect yourself and your practice</li>
        <li><strong>Simple website:</strong> One page is enough to start</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling tool:</strong> Calendly or similar—clients should be able to book without email tag</li>
        <li><strong>Video platform:</strong> Zoom works fine</li>
        <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> Stripe or Square</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's it. You can add more sophisticated tools later. Right now, you need to be able to take calls and get paid.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Step 4: Price Your Services</h2>
      <p>New coaches almost always underprice themselves. Here's a simple framework:</p>
      <p>Research what coaches in your niche charge. Then price yourself in the middle of that range—not at the bottom. Cheap prices signal low value, and they attract clients who don't take the work seriously.</p>
      <p>If you're nervous about charging "real" rates, offer a few pro bono sessions to build testimonials, then transition to paid work. Don't get stuck in free-coaching limbo.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Step 5: Get Your First Clients</h2>
      <p>Here's where most aspiring coaches get stuck. The secret? You probably already know your first clients.</p>
      <p>Start with your network. Not with a sales pitch, but with genuine conversations. Tell people what you're doing. Ask who they know who might benefit. Offer a free discovery call to anyone who's curious.</p>
      <p>Your first 10 clients will likely come from people you already know or people one degree removed. After that, referrals and testimonials will do the heavy lifting.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Step 6: Deliver Exceptional Work</h2>
      <p>This is the part that matters most—and the part no business advice can teach you. Show up fully for your clients. Do the work. Get them results.</p>
      <p>A coaching practice is built on reputation. Every client you serve becomes a potential ambassador for your work. Treat them accordingly.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>Building a coaching practice isn't complicated. It requires clarity about who you serve, the courage to put yourself out there, and the commitment to deliver real value.</p>
      <p>Stop planning. Start coaching. The rest will follow.</p>
