    <div class="article-content" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
      <p>Most coaches became coaches because they love coaching—not marketing. But here's the reality: you can be the best coach in the world, and it won't matter if nobody knows you exist.</p>
      <p>The good news? Marketing for coaches doesn't have to feel sleazy or overwhelming. Here's a straightforward approach that works.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Start With Your Website</h2>
      <p>Your website is your home base. It doesn't need to be elaborate, but it needs to do three things:</p>
      <ol style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li><strong>Clearly communicate who you help and how:</strong> A visitor should understand this within 5 seconds of landing on your page.</li>
        <li><strong>Establish credibility:</strong> Credentials, testimonials, your story—whatever helps visitors trust you.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it easy to take the next step:</strong> A prominent call-to-action (book a call, download a resource, join your list).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>One page can accomplish all of this. Don't let website perfectionism delay your launch.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Choose One Social Platform and Own It</h2>
      <p>You don't need to be everywhere. In fact, trying to be everywhere usually means being effective nowhere.</p>
      <p>Pick one platform where your ideal clients spend time:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Best for executive, career, and business coaches</li>
        <li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Strong for life, wellness, and relationship coaches</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> Excellent for coaches who enjoy teaching on camera</li>
        <li><strong>TikTok:</strong> Growing platform for reaching younger audiences</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Commit to showing up consistently on that one platform for at least 6 months before evaluating or expanding.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Content That Converts</h2>
      <p>The best marketing content for coaches follows a simple formula: <strong>be useful</strong>.</p>
      <p>Share insights that help your audience solve real problems. Give away your best stuff. This feels counterintuitive—won't people just take the free advice and leave?</p>
      <p>No. The opposite happens. When you demonstrate your expertise through helpful content, people think: "If the free stuff is this good, imagine what working with them must be like."</p>
      <p>Content ideas that work:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Common mistakes you see clients make (and how to avoid them)</li>
        <li>Quick wins your audience can implement today</li>
        <li>Your perspective on industry trends or debates</li>
        <li>Client success stories (with permission)</li>
        <li>Behind-the-scenes of your coaching process</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Build an Email List</h2>
      <p>Social media platforms come and go. Algorithms change. But your email list is yours.</p>
      <p>Create a simple lead magnet—a free guide, checklist, or mini-course that addresses a specific pain point for your audience. Offer it in exchange for an email address.</p>
      <p>Then nurture that list. Send valuable content regularly (weekly is ideal). When someone is ready to hire a coach, you'll be top of mind.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">SEO Basics for Coaches</h2>
      <p>Search engine optimization sounds technical, but the basics are simple:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Write content that answers questions your ideal clients are Googling</li>
        <li>Include relevant keywords naturally in your website copy</li>
        <li>Create separate pages for each service you offer</li>
        <li>Get listed in coaching directories (like NAIC!)</li>
        <li>Encourage clients to leave Google reviews</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SEO is a long game, but it compounds. Content you create today can bring you clients for years.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">The Power of Referrals</h2>
      <p>Never underestimate word-of-mouth. It remains the most effective marketing channel for coaches.</p>
      <p>Make it easy for satisfied clients to refer others:</p>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Ask directly (most clients are happy to help but don't think of it unprompted)</li>
        <li>Provide shareable resources they can pass along</li>
        <li>Consider a referral incentive (discount on future sessions, gift card, etc.)</li>
        <li>Stay in touch with past clients through your email list</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Avoid These Common Mistakes</h2>
      <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li><strong>Being too generic:</strong> "I help people live their best life" tells me nothing. Be specific.</li>
        <li><strong>Talking about yourself instead of your client:</strong> Your website should be about their transformation, not your credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Marketing works through repetition. Showing up once a month isn't enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Expecting overnight results:</strong> Marketing is a marathon. Give strategies time to work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Your Marketing Action Plan</h2>
      <ol style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 24px;">
        <li>Get a simple website live (this week)</li>
        <li>Choose one social platform and commit to posting 3x/week</li>
        <li>Create one lead magnet and start building your email list</li>
        <li>Ask your last three clients for referrals and testimonials</li>
        <li>Review and adjust after 90 days</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Marketing doesn't have to consume your life. A focused, consistent approach will build your practice over time—and let you spend most of your energy where it belongs: coaching.</p>
